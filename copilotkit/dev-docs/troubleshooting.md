# Troubleshooting

Ordered by how often each one wastes an afternoon. Every entry here has already
cost somebody real time.

## It boots, reports online, and answers nothing

**1. The Channel is `setup_required`, not `online`.**
`channels.ready()` resolves on `setup_required` too, because a declared-but-
unprovisioned Channel counts as a valid degraded state. `server.ts` gates on
`status().overall === "online"` for exactly this reason — if you removed that
check, put it back.

```bash
npm run channel:status
```

**2. You cannot see the diagnostic.** Lifecycle breadcrumbs are emitted at `warn`
while the runtime logger defaults to `error`, so the single most useful line —
`channel "<name>" requires setup` — is written and discarded.

```dotenv
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

**3. The bot is not in the channel.** Workspace-installed is not the same as
channel member. Slack emits no `app_mention` event *at all* for a channel the app
is not in. `/invite @yourbot`.

**4. Another runtime is stealing the delivery.** Two runtimes declaring the same
Channel name in one project race per delivery and the loser gets nothing,
silently. The tell: a Slack reply your terminal knows nothing about. Give your
laptop its own Intelligence project.

**5. You are testing without a mention.** A non-mentioned turn only ever reaches
`onMessage`, and this kit gates that on `thread.isSubscribed()`. Verify with a
channel mention first.

## The dashboard looks broken but is not

- **Agent run: `—`** even after a successful turn — expected.
- **Overview: `AGENT: Not declared`** — expected.
- **An `…:activation` pseudo-thread** — only means the runtime activated.

The tab that proves a round trip is **Usage**: completed turns, plus non-zero
outbound.

## "Waiting for runtime"

`CHANNEL_CODE` does not match the Channel Code in Intelligence. It is validated
by the runtime at startup, not by `createChannel`, so a typo fails late.
Character for character: lowercase letters and digits, single hyphens, starts
with a letter.

## It will not compile

**`separate declarations of a private property '_debug'`** — two copies of
`@ag-ui/client`. The root `package.json` pins it via `overrides`; check it still
matches what the runtime declares:

```bash
npm ls @ag-ui/client     # every line should read the same version
```

**JSX errors, or props that "don't exist"** — the file must be `.tsx` and the
tsconfig must set `jsxImportSource: "@copilotkit/channels"`. Without it the tree
compiles against React.

**`TS1309: The current file is a CommonJS module`** — `"type": "module"` is
missing from that package.json. The startup code uses top-level `await`.

**A handler "is not assignable to type `() => void`"** — `thread.post()` returns
a `MessageRef`. Use a block body: `async ({ thread }) => { await thread.post(…); }`

## The agent calls one tool and then gives up

`maxSteps` defaults to **1** on `BuiltInAgent`. The kit sets 10 in
`packages/agent-core/src/agent.ts`.

## Slash commands and modals never fire

They are not delivered on the managed path. Code that registers `onCommand` or
`onModalSubmit` compiles, starts, reports online, and stays silent. Buttons and
selects do work — build the interaction with those.

## An `xapp-` token is in my .env

Remove it. Socket Mode belongs only to the direct-adapter path; a managed
Channel needs no app-level token and the pre-flight check fails on it
deliberately.

## Teams installs cleanly and authenticates nothing

You used a signing secret. Slack authenticates with a signing secret; Teams
authenticates with a Microsoft-signed bearer JWT verified against Entra. Crossing
them is the most expensive failure mode here because it looks like it worked.

## `AI SDK Warning: System messages in the prompt or messages fields…`

Harmless and not yours. `BuiltInAgent`'s `prompt` option becomes a system message
in the messages array, and the AI SDK warns about that pattern generically. It
does not mean your prompt is being injected.

## Provider errors are swallowed in local-chat

They arrive through the run lifecycle rather than as a rejection from
`runAgent()`. `apps/local-chat` subscribes to `onRunFailed` for this. If you
write your own loop, do the same or you get an unhandled rejection with a
thirty-line stack.

## `ERR_USE_AFTER_CLOSE`

`rl.question()` after stdin closed — happens whenever input is piped rather than
typed. `apps/local-chat` guards on `rl.once("close")`.

## `npm install` fails with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'edgesOut')"

You added **vitest**. `@copilotkit/channels` declares `vitest: ^4.0.0` as a peer
dependency, and npm's dependency resolver crashes trying to reconcile that with
vitest as a direct dependency — at the root *or* in a workspace, and from a
completely clean `node_modules`. The error names nothing useful.

That is why this kit tests with **`node:test`**, Node's built-in runner: no
install, no peer conflict, and `mock.fn()` covers what `vi.fn()` was doing.

```bash
npm test          # node --import tsx --test 'src/**/*.test.tsx'
```

If you genuinely need vitest, `--legacy-peer-deps` gets you past it — put it in
`.npmrc` so it applies to every install, not just the one you remember.

## Still stuck

- `npm run verify` — typecheck, tests, and a real MCP protocol round trip
- `npm run check-env` — numbered list of what is missing
- `npm run channel:status` — real doctor command for the Channel
- `.agents/skills/build-channels-agent/SKILL.md` — the verified API surface plus
  a "common mistakes" list
- The canonical, never-stale setup workflow: <https://copilotkit.ai/channels-guide.md>

> One stale doc to know about: `docs.copilotkit.ai/slack/deploy-and-operate`
> still tells you to install `@copilotkit/channels@0.6.1` with
> `@copilotkit/runtime@1.65.0`. Use the versions in this repo's `package.json`.
